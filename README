Brim.Net Core Package

A general-use Python 2 programming library I'd worked on for a time, but I don't expect to improve any longer; maintenance is a possibility though.

This is the core package for Brim.Net Python-based applications.

It provides some reusable utility code and provides brimd, a launcher offering
ease of deployment of WSGI applications (currently just using the Eventlet WSGI
server), straight TCP and UDP socket applications, and maintaining background
daemons.
